Description 2-6 sentences:

The Android Application that the project team 
seeks to develop targets a weather API, gets data and parses the data.
The user of the application can type in the Location,
Then presses the button "show weather", finally receives data 
for it for example 2 to 3 weeks into the future.

Then, in the start menu of the appliaction, 
the user can see his recent searches
in a list (local storage), each row shows a minimum of data
like "Barcelona, appr. 23 Degrees Celcius". 
So if the user clicks a row, he gets the 
complete data again for the week and weather.
If the user wants to delete a row, he can do that with 
the click on the "X"-Button, right side.
