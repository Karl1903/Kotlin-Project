Description 2-6 sentences:

The Android Application that the project team 
seeks to develop targets a weather API, gets data and parses the data.
The user of the application can type in the Location/ town (SearchFragment).
Then presses the button to get the weather data.
the data gets saved into the local storage database.
then the user is navigated to the WeatherFragment.
There the weather data is retrieved from the database.
finally the data is presented in the Layout.

Then, in the start menu of the appliaction 
(MainActivity, MainFragment), 
the user can see his recent searches
in a list (local storage).
The row shows a minimum of data
like "Barcelona, appr. 23 Degrees Celcius". 
So if the user clicks a row, 
she is navigated to the WeatherFragment directly
there the data is presented.
If the user wants to delete a row, he can do that with 
the click on the "X"-Button, right side.
